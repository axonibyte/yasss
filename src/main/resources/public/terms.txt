# Terms of Service

**Yasss!** is an open source sign-up platform for folks who are tired of being
required to subscribe to other popular platforms out on the web. We've done what
we can to make this platform as seamless for folks as possible, but as with any
online service there are a few things we want to make sure that users know and
agree with so that this platform remains safe for everyone.

These terms of service govern your use of this particular deployment of
**Yasss!** and do not necessarily pertain to the software artifacts themselves.
If you want to learn more about your rights and responsibilities regarding your
ability to download, modify, use, and distribute the source code artifacts built
from the source code, please review the
[license](https://bitbucket.org/axonibyte/yasss/src/main/LICENSE.txt).
**You must abide by the terms and conditions herein if you are to use this platform.**

Conditions for using this service are fairly simple, and can be broken down as
follows:

- You must be over the age of fourteen (14) to use this platform.
- You may not attempt to hack, break into, or otherwise circumvent this platform.
- You may not post obscene or illegal materials to the platform.
- You may not use the platform to send unsolicited mail to anyone.
- You may not issue chargebacks or demand refunds for published events.

Please keep in mind that we monitor the platform to keep it safe, and we take
corrective action where necessary. This may include, but is not limited to:

- Unpublishing of any event for any reason, even if the event was paid for.
- Changing the text associated with any event for any reason, even if the event
  was paid for.
- Deactivating accounts or blocking machines, networks, or IP addresses that
  we think are responsible for or are being used in a manner that violates our
  standards, even if they are associated with paid events.
- Legal action against bad actors.

Please keep in mind that we're not a very large company and we are bound to run
into Murphy's Law at one point or another. We will do our best to make sure that
services remain online, but as a paying user you should be aware that we are not
providing a warranty or guarantee regarding the quality or uptime of our services.

## Events

When you pay to publish an event, that event will get published as soon as our
service detects that the payment has been made. We've designed the platform so
that you don't need to sign up in order to publish an event, but please understand
that if you haven't signed up, you won't be able to edit those events once
published.

We also want to prevent users from abusing our system by indefinitely extending
events. We do this by preventing edits to events after their first windows have
passed. Please understand that attempting to circumvent this (through
chargebacks, breaching the system, or other tomfoolery) will result in your
access being terminated indefinitely.

## Branding

You're more than welcome to keep or get rid of the **Yasss!** logo and branding
if you redistribute this platform, but you do need to include our copyright
(included at the bottom of the home page). Please don't otherwise represent us or
act on our behalf.
