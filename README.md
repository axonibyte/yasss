# Yet Another Service Scheduling System (YASSS)

Copyright (c) 2024 CrowdEase, LLC.

This system is designed as an open source alternative to other proprietary
volunteer scheduling systems that are available on the web. This platform allows
organizations to create their own volunteer sign-up sheets, and for volunteers
to sign up for predefined time slots and optionally receive reminders.
